# Simple-Hangman
Completed: 28/04/2021

A simple, single-player command line hangman game for guessing dictionary words in MATLAB. The user guesses a single letter (lowercase); if it is incorrect, the number of lives decreases and the hangman illustration appears one line at a time.

The game offers two modes of difficulty - easy or hard - with the number of lives currently fixed at 10. Tested against invalid inputs.

## How to Run
Run the 'MAIN' file in MATLAB.
