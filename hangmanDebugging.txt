Issues encountered:

1) when entering the same correctly guessed letter(s) multiple times, program continues adding all of these repeated correct letters to the vector
	- The length of the correctLetters vector is used to check when user has correctly guessed all letters of the word
	- Since it keeps adding letters already guessed, a 'Congratulations' message is displayed when length of vector matches length of the word,
	even though all letters have not been correctly guessed

	TEST EXAMPLE:
	Word: zigzag (length = 6)
	
	Guess 1: z
	z--z--
	correctLetters = [z z]

	Guess 2: z
	z--z--
	correctLetters = [z z z z]

	Guess 3: z
	z--z--
	correctLetters = [z z z z z z] --> length=6
	Congratulations, you've correctly guessed the word!

2) Similar issue as above, but for incorrectly guessed letters (both are fixed in checkGuessPt2)

3) When user inputs special characters or space, lives decrease and guesses increase (fixed using checkInput function)

4) Hangman parts are only shown when user guesses a wrong letter, but hangman does not show when user guesses correct 
(fixed by calling function in both conditions - see line 66 of displayHangman script)

5) When doing the above, whole hangman picture appears after first guess
(fixed in showHangman function by making switch statement display empty array)
